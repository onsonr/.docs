## Introducing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental component of decentralized identity systems. A DID is a unique, globally resolvable identifier that is generated and managed by the identity owner. Unlike traditional identifiers, such as usernames or email addresses, DIDs are not issued by a central authority but are instead created and controlled by the user themselves.

In his original 1989 proposal for what would become the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee outlined a vision of a “universal linked information system” where users would have control over their own data.
He foresaw a decentralized architecture where information would be stored in “nodes” that users could link together through “links” in whatever way made sense to them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Web1 Identifiers (1990s)">
    In the early days of the internet known as Web1: Digital identity was
    limited and decentralized People used anonymous usernames or email addresses
    to identify themselves There were no widespread standards or protocols for
    proving one's identity online
  </Step>
  <Step title="Web2 Identifiers (2000s)">
    As the internet became more advanced in the Web2 era: Centralized identity
    providers emerged like Google, Facebook, Twitter Single sign-on allowed
    using one identity across multiple websites This made identity more
    convenient but gave control to a few big tech companies Privacy concerns
    emerged around tracking and data collection by identity providers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Web3 Identifiers (2010s-Present)">
    Web3 is ushering in a new phase of digital identity: Blockchain technology
    enables decentralized, user-controlled identity Decentralized identifiers
    (DIDs) give users more control of their data Verifiable credentials allow
    proving claims without oversharing personal info Self-sovereign identity
    (SSI) puts users in charge of their identities But standards are still
    emerging and adoption is in early stages
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Path Forward (2024-Beyond)">
    Digital identity has evolved from limited and decentralized, to convenient
    but centralized, to user-empowered but complex
  </Step>

## The Technical Aspects of DIDs

A DID consists of three main components:

- **Scheme**: The identifier for the DID method, such as “did”.
- **Method**: The specific DID method used, such as “example”.
- **Method-Specific Identifier**: A unique identifier within the context of the DID method.

Example DID: `did:example:123456789abcdefghi`

## Decentralized Identity Methods

DID methods define the specific implementation details for creating, resolving, and managing DIDs on different distributed ledger technologies or decentralized systems. Each DID method has its own specification, which outlines the technical requirements and procedures for working with DIDs within that particular ecosystem.

| DID Method | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| did:ethr   | Ethereum-based DIDs                 |
| did:sov    | Sovrin-based DIDs                   |
| did:ion    | Identity Overlay Network (ION) DIDs |
| did:web    | Web-based DIDs                      |

## Decentralized Identity Resolution

DID resolution is the process of retrieving the DID Document associated with a given DID. The resolution process involves querying the appropriate distributed ledger or decentralized storage system based on the DID method specified in the DID.
